"""
This folder contains scripts which can be run to test the dimensionality of the various outputs during the forward pass
of the machine learning models in the modules folder. Some scripts are ready to be run, and made up of random data.
For this reason, they are useful to check that the modules run as expected and preserve the dimensionality of the
elements, however these scripts are not suitable for actually training or testing the models.
