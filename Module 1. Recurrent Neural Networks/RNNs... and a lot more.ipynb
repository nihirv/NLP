    "# Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are designed to make use of sequential data, when the current step has some kind of relation with the previous steps. This makes them ideal for applications with a time component (audio, time-series data) and natural language. RNNs are networks for which value of a unit depends on its own previous output as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/RNN_basic.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An input vector representing the current input element $x_t$ is multiplied by a weight matrix $W$ and then passed through an activation function to compute an activation value for a layer of hidden units. This hidden layer is, in turn, used to calculate a corresponding output, $y_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$h_t = g(Uh_{t-1}+Wx_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_t = a(Vh_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layer from the previous time step $h_{t-1}$ provides a form of memory, or context, that encodes earlier processing and informs the decisions to be made at later points in time. $U$ determine how the network should make use of past context. RNNs do not impose any limit on this prior context. The context includes information dating back to the beginning of the sequence. Three sets of weights are updated at each timestep: $W$, $U$ and $V$.\n",

    "## Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, with this increased complexity in structure, the optimization method does not become any more difficult. Despite having a different name, back-propagation through time, it is essentially the same thing. All you do is feed in your sequence sequentially to get the output, as usual. You then just calculate your error at each timestep and sum it as opposed to calculating the error at a single timestep like standard neural networks. Then you can use gradient descent to update your weights iteratively until you are satisfied with your network's performance.\n",

    "## RNNs for Text Classification Task\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many variations of RNNâ€™s likely Many-One, Many-Many, etc. In our case we aim to classify the input text into positive and negative class. So, set of Many-One LSTM units achieves the task as only one value needs to be outputted for determining the polarity of the review. Usually this is the last RNN hidden state as the one that summarises the whole sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why RNNs better than FFNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "FFNNs do not take context into account. Each word is represented by its embedding independent of other words. RNNs encodes each new word (token) considering the previous words. Meaning of words can change depending on the context. For example, compare the meanings of the word \"mean\" in those two sentences \"I compute the mean\" and \"His behaviour was mean\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How the model is evaluated ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural choise is accuracy - \n",
    "percentage of all the examples that our model labeled correctly. However, it is not good for unbalanced datasets. Imagine a dataset with 999,900 positive examples and 100 negative examples. A very bad classifier can assign positive class to all the examples. This classifier would have 999,900 true negatives and only 100 false negatives and an accuracy of\n",
    "999,900/1,000,000 or 99.99%! \n",
    "\n",
    "Other metrics, more useful for such datasets are: precision, recall and F-measure. Precision measures the percentage of the items that the system labelled as positive and are positive accroding to the gold labels. Recall measures the percentage of items labelled as positive out of all the gold positive items. F-score is the weighted harmonic mean of the precision and recall. \n",

Gradient can be viewed as a measure of the effect of the past on the future. If the gradient becomes vanishingly small over longer distances we can not capture the dependency to the past correctly. For example: \"A patient with a rare sarcoma of soft tissue on the left thigh was presented to the hospital yesterday.\" \"was presented\" depends on \"a patient\", but they are separated by 11 words!\n",
